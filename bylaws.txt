### Calling Special Meetings ###

A special meeting called by any person entitled to call a meeting of the members shall be called by written request, specifying the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and submitted to the chair of the board, if any, or the president or any vice president or the secretary of the corporation.

transmission by and to the corporation or electronic video screen communication, if any, by which members may participate in the meeting.

  * Electing to wind up and dissolve the corporation.

Notice given by electronic transmission by the corporation shall be valid only if:

  * Delivered by:
      * facsimile telecommunication or electronic mail when directed to the facsimile number or electronic mail address, respectively, for that recipient on record with the corporation;
      * posting on an electronic message board or network that the corporation has designated for those communications, together with a separate notice to the recipient of the posting, which transmission shall be validly delivered on the later of the posting or delivery of the separate notice of it; or

  * An electronic transmission by this corporation to a member is not authorized unless, in addition to satisfying the requirements of this section, the transmission satisfies the requirements applicable to consumer consent to electronic record as set forth in the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (15 United States Code section 7001 (c)(1)).
  * Notice shall not be given by electronic transmission by the corporation after either of the following:

# Voting #

## Eligibility to Vote ##

Subject to the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law, all members in good standing on the record date as determined under [Record Date] of these bylaws shall be entitled to vote at any meeting of members.  Each member entitled to vote may cast one vote on each matter submitted to a vote of the members. Members may not cumulate votes for the election of directors.

For any decision that is stalled by opposition of a minority of voting members, a committee chaired by those in opposition shall be charged with the responsibility of assessing the conflict and developing an alternative course of action that better serves the mission of the Corporation. If this is not done within a reasonable time as determined by the board, a two-thirds majority vote shall decide the appropriate course of action.

## Actions Without Meetings / Action by Unanimous Written Consent ##

Any action required or permitted to be taken by the members may be taken without a meeting, if all members consent in writing to the action. The written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the meeting. The action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the members.

## Record Date ##

### Record Date for Notice, Voting, and Other Board Actions ###

For purposes of establishing the members entitled to receive notice of any meeting, entitled to vote at any meeting, or entitled to exercise any rights in any lawful action, the board of directors may, in advance, fix a record date. The record date so fixed for

  * voting at a meeting shall be no more than 60 days before the date of the meeting;
  * taking any other action shall be no more than 60 days before that action.

### Record Date for Actions Not Set by Board ###

If not otherwise fixed by the board, the record date for determining members entitled to receive notice of a meeting of members shall be the next business day preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, the next business day preceding the day on which the meeting is held. If not otherwise fixed by the board, the record date for determining members entitled to vote at the meeting shall be the day on which the meeting is held.

If not otherwise fixed by the board, the record date for determining members entitled to exercise any rights with respect to any other lawful action shall be the date on which the board adopts the resolution relating to that action, or the 60th day before the date of that action, whichever is later.

For purposes of this Section, a person holding a membership at the close of business on the record date shall be a member of record.

## Proxies ##

### Members' Proxy Rights ###

Each member entitled to vote shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy, signed by the person and filed with the secretary of the corporation. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the member's name is placed on the proxy by the member or the member's attorney-in-fact, whether by manual signature, typewriting, facsimile transmission, or otherwise.

### Subject Matter of Proxy to Be Stated ###

Any proxy covering matters for which a vote of the members is required shall not be valid unless the proxy sets forth the general nature of the matter to be voted on or, in an election of directors, the proxy lists the persons who have been nominated at the time the notice of the vote is given to the members. Such matters include amendments of the articles of incorporation or bylaws changing proxy rights; certain other amendments of the articles of incorporation; removal of directors without cause; filling vacancies on the board of directors; the sale, lease, exchange, conveyance, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all corporate assets, unless the transaction is in the usual and regular course of the corporation's activities; the principal terms of a merger or the amendment of a merger agreement; or the election to dissolve the corporation.

### Revocability of Proxies ###

No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date of the proxy, unless provided otherwise in the proxy, except that the maximum term of a proxy shall be three years after the date of execution. A validly executed proxy shall continue in full force and effect until either

  * it is revoked by the member executing it, before the vote is cast under that proxy
      * by a writing delivered to the corporation stating that the proxy is revoked, or
      * by a subsequent proxy executed by that member and presented to the meeting, or
      * as to any meeting, by that member's personal attendance and voting at the meeting; or
  * written notice of the death or incapacity of the maker of the proxy is received by the corporation before the vote under that proxy is counted. A proxy may not be irrevocable.

## Adjournment and Notice of Adjourned Meetings ##

Any members' meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of the majority of the members represented at the meeting, either in person or by proxy. No meeting may be adjourned for more than 45 days. When a members' meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned (or the means of electronic transmission by and to the corporation or electronic video screen communication, if any, by which members may participate) are announced at the meeting at which adjournment is taken. If after adjournment a new record date is fixed for notice or voting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each member who, on the record date for notice of the meeting, is entitled to vote at the meeting. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting.

The board may appoint one or more directors as alternate members of any such committee, who may replace any absent member at any meeting. Any such committee shall have all the authority of the board, to the extent provided in the board resolution, except that no committee may do the following:

  * Take any final action on any matter that, under the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law, also requires approval of the members or approval of a majority of all members;

### Meetings and Action of Committees ###

Meetings and actions of committees of the board shall be governed by, held, and taken under the provisions of these bylaws concerning meetings and other board actions, except that the time for general meetings of such committees and the calling of special meetings of such committees may be set either by board resolution or, if none, by resolution of the committee. Minutes of each meeting shall be kept and shall be filed with the corporate records. The board may adopt rules for the governance of any committee as long as the rules are consistent with these bylaws. If the board has not adopted rules, the committee may do so.

# Contracts With Directors #

No director of this corporation nor any other corporation, firm, association, or other entity in which one or more of this corporation's directors are directors or have a material financial interest, shall be interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract or transaction with this corporation, unless

  * the material facts regarding that director's financial interest in such contract or transaction or regarding such common directorship, officership, or financial interest are fully disclosed in good faith and noted in the minutes, or are known to all members of the board prior to the board's consideration of such contract or transaction;
  * such contract or transaction is authorized in good faith by a majority of the board by a vote sufficient for that purpose without counting the votes of the interested directors;
  * before authorizing or approving the transaction, the board considers and in good faith decides after reasonable investigation that the corporation could not obtain a more advantageous arrangement with reasonable effort under the circumstances; and
  * the corporation for its own benefit enters into the transaction, which is fair and reasonable to the corporation at the time the transaction is entered into.

This Section does not apply to a transaction that is part of an educational or charitable program of this corporation if it

  * is approved or authorized by the corporation in good faith and without unjustified favoritism and
  * results in a benefit to one or more directors or their families because they are in the class of persons intended to be benefited by the educational or charitable program of this corporation,

# Loans to Directors and Officers #

This corporation shall not lend any money or property to or guarantee the obligation of any director or officer without the approval of the California Attorney General, provided, however, that the corporation may advance money to a director or officer of the corporation for expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in the performance of his or her duties if that director or officer would be entitled to reimbursement for such expenses by the corporation.

# Indemnification #

To the fullest extent permitted by law, this corporation shall indemnify its directors, officers, employees, and other persons described in Corporations Code section 5238(a), including persons formerly occupying any such positions, against all expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with any "proceeding," as that term is used in that section, and including an action by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a person described in that section. "Expenses," as used in this bylaw, shall have the same meaning as in that section of the Corporations Code. On written request to the board by any person seeking indemnification under Corporations Code section 5238(b) or section 5238(c) the board shall promptly decide under Corporations Code section 5238(e) whether the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Corporations Code section 5238(b) or section 5238(c) has been met and, if so, the board shall authorize indemnification. If the board cannot authorize indemnification, because the number of directors who are parties to the proceeding with respect to which indemnification is sought prevents the formation of a quorum of directors who are not parties to that proceeding, the board shall promptly call a meeting of members. At that meeting, the members shall determine under Corporations Code section 5238(e) whether the applicable standard of conduct has been met and, if so, the members present at the meeting in person or by proxy shall authorize indemnification.

To the fullest extent permitted by law and except as otherwise determined by the board in a specific instance, expenses incurred by a person seeking indemnification under this Article of these bylaws in defending any proceeding covered by that Section shall be advanced by the corporation before final disposition of the proceeding, on receipt by the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of that person that the advance will be repaid unless it is ultimately found that the person is entitled to be indemnified by the corporation for those expenses.

# Insurance #

This corporation shall have the right, and shall use its best efforts, to purchase and maintain insurance to the full extent permitted by law on behalf of its officers, directors, employees, and other agents, to cover any liability asserted against or incurred by any officer, director, employee, or agent in such capacity or arising from the officer's, director's, employee's, or agent's status as such.

# Maintenance of Corporate Records #

This corporation shall keep the following:

  * Adequate and correct books and records of account;
  * Minutes of the proceedings of its members, board, and committees of the board; and
  * A record of each member's name, address, and class of membership.

The minutes and other books and records shall be kept either in written form or in any other form capable of being converted into clearly legible tangible form or in any combination of the two.

# Inspection Rights #

## Members' Right to Inspect ##

### Membership Records ###

Unless the corporation provides a reasonable alternative as provided below, any member may do either or both of the following for a purpose reasonably related to the member's interest as a member:

  * Inspect and copy the records containing members' names, addresses, and voting rights during usual business hours on five days' prior written demand on the corporation, which must state the purpose for which the inspection rights are requested; or
  * Obtain from the secretary of the corporation, on written demand and tender of a reasonable charge, a list of names, addresses, and voting rights of members who are entitled to vote for directors as of the most recent record date for which that list has been compiled, or as of the date, after the date of demand, specified by the member. The demand shall state the purpose for which the list is requested. The secretary shall make this list available to the member on or before the later of ten days after the demand is received or the date specified in the demand as the date as of which the list is to be compiled.

The corporation may, within ten business days after receiving a demand under this Section, make a written offer of an alternative method of reasonable and timely achievement of the proper purpose specified in the demand without providing access to or a copy of the membership list. Any rejection of this offer must be in writing and must state the reasons the proposed alternative does not meet the proper purpose of the demand.

If the corporation reasonably believes that the information will be used for a purpose other than one reasonably related to a person's interest as a member, or if it provides a reasonable alternative under this Section, it may deny the member access to the membership list. Any inspection and copying under this Section may be made in person or by the member's agent or attorney. The right of inspection includes the right to copy and make extracts. This right of inspection extends to the records of any subsidiary of the corporation.

### Accounting Records and Minutes ###

On written demand on the corporation, any member may inspect, copy, and make extracts of the accounting books and records and the minutes of the proceedings of the members, the board of directors, and committees of the board at any reasonable time for a purpose reasonably related to the member's interest as a member. Any such inspection and copying may be made in person or by the member's agent or attorney. This right of inspection extends to the records of any subsidiary of the corporation.

### Maintenance and Inspection of Articles and Bylaws ###

This corporation shall keep at its principal California office the original or a copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended to the current date, which shall be open to inspection by the members at all reasonable times during office hours. If the corporation has no business office in California, the secretary shall, on the written request of any member, furnish to that member a copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended to the current date.

## Directors' Right to Inspect ##

Every director shall have the absolute right at any reasonable time to inspect the corporation's books, records, documents of every kind, physical properties, and the records of each subsidiary. The

The board shall cause an annual report to be sent to the members and directors within 120 days after the end of the corporation's fiscal year. That report shall contain the following information, in appropriate detail:

  * The assets and liabilities, including the trust funds, of the corporation as of the end of the fiscal year;
  * The principal changes in assets and liabilities, including trust funds;
  * The corporation's revenue or receipts, both unrestricted and restricted to particular purposes;
  * The corporation's expenses or disbursements for both general and restricted purposes;
  * Any information required by [Maintenance and Inspection of Articles and Bylaws] of these bylaws; and
  * An independent accountants' report or, if none, the certificate of an authorized officer of the corporation that such statements were prepared without audit from the corporation's books and records. This requirement of an annual report shall not apply if the corporation receives less than $25,000 in gross receipts during the fiscal year, provided, however, that the information specified above for inclusion in an annual report must be furnished annually to all directors and to any member who requests it in writing. If the board approves, the corporation may send the report and any accompanying material sent pursuant to this section by electronic transmission.

## Annual Statement of Certain Transactions and Indemnifications ##

As part of the annual report to all members, or as a separate document if no annual report is issued, the corporation shall, within 120 days after the end of the corporation's fiscal year, annually prepare and mail, deliver, or send by electronic transmission to each member and furnish to each director a statement of any transaction or indemnification of the following kind:

  * Any transaction
      * in which the corporation, or its parent or subsidiary, was a party,
      * in which an "interested person" had a direct or indirect material financial interest, and
      * which involved more than $50,000 or was one of several transactions with the same interested person involving, in the aggregate, more than $50,000. For this purpose, an "interested person" is either
          * any director or officer of the corporation, its parent or subsidiary (but mere common directorship shall not be considered such an interest); or
          * any holder of more than 10 percent of the voting power of the corporation, its parent, or its subsidiary. The statement shall include a brief description of the transaction, the names of interested persons involved, their relationship to the corporation, the nature of their interest in the transaction and, if practicable, the amount of that interest, provided that if the transaction was with a partnership in which the interested person is a partner, only the interest of the partnership need be stated.
  * Any indemnifications or advances aggregating more than $10,000 paid during the fiscal year to any officer or director of the corporation under [Indemnification] of these bylaws, unless that indemnification has already been approved by the members under Corporations Code section 5238(e)(2).

# Construction and Definitions #

Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions in the California Nonprofit Corporation Law shall govern the construction of these bylaws.

# Amendment of Bylaws #

## Amendment by Directors ##
The Board may adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.  Such power is subject to the following limitations:

  * Where any provision of these Bylaws requires the vote of a larger proportion of the Directors than otherwise is required by law, such provision may not be altered, amended or repealed except by the vote of such greater number.
  * No amendment may extend the term of a Director beyond that for which such Director was elected.
  * If bylaws are adopted, amended or repealed at a meeting of the Board, such action is authorized only at a duly called and held meeting for which written notice of such meeting, setting forth the proposed bylaw revisions with explanations therefor, is given in accordance with these Bylaws, unless such notice is waived in accordance with these Bylaws.
