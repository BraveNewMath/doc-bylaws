### Events Causing Vacancies on Board ###

A vacancy or vacancies on the board of directors shall occur in the event of

  * the death, removal, or resignation of any director;
  * the declaration by resolution of the board of a vacancy in the office of a director who has been convicted of a felony, declared of unsound mind by a court order, or found by final order or judgment of any court to have breached a duty under California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law, Chapter 2, Article 3;

### Resignation of Directors ###

Except as provided below, any director may resign by giving written notice to the chairman of the board, if any, or to the president or the secretary of the board. The resignation shall be effective when the notice is given unless it specifies a later time for the resignation to become effective. If a director's resignation is effective at a later time, the board may elect a successor to take office as of the date when the resignation becomes effective. Except on notice to the California Attorney General, no director may resign if the corporation would be left without a duly elected director or directors.

### Removal of Directors ###

Any vacancy caused by the removal of a director shall be filled as provided in [Special Meetings][].
  * Any director who does not attend three successive board meetings will automatically be removed from the board without board resolution unless
      * the director requests a leave of absence for a limited period of time, and the leave is approved by the directors at a regular or special meeting (if such leave is granted, the number of board members will be reduced by one in determining whether a quorum is or is not present),
      * the director suffers from an illness or disability that prevents him or her from attending meetings and the board by resolution waives the automatic, removal procedure of this subsection; or
      * the board by resolution of the majority of board members must agree before a director who has missed three meetings may be reinstated,

## Filling Vacancies on Board of Directors ##

Vacancies on the board may be filled by approval of the board or, if the number of directors then in office is less than a quorum, by

  * the unanimous written consent of the directors then in office,
  * the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office at a meeting held according to notice or waivers of notice complying with Corporations Code section 5211, or
  * a sole remaining director. The board may fill any vacancy not filled by the directors.

## No Vacancy on Reduction of Number of Directors ##

Any reduction of the authorized number of directors shall not result in any director's being removed before his or her term of office expires.

## Meetings of Board of Directors ##

Meetings of the board shall be held at any place within or outside California that has been designated by resolution of the board or in the notice of the meeting or, if not so designated, at the principal office of the corporation.

Other general meetings of the board may be held without notice at such time and place as the board may fix from time to time.

### Special Meetings ###

#### Authority to Call Special Meetings ####

Special meetings of the board for any purpose may be called at any time by the chairman of the board, if any, the president or any vice president, the secretary, or any two directors.

#### Notice of Special Meetings ####

Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be given to each director by

  * personal delivery of written notice;
  * first-class mail, postage prepaid;
  * telephone, including a voice messaging system or other system or technology designed to record and communicate messages, or by electronic transmission, either directly to the director or to a person at the director's office who would reasonably be expected to communicate that notice promptly to the director;
  * facsimile;
  * electronic mail; or
  * other electronic means.

All such notices shall be given or sent to the director's address or telephone number as shown on the corporation's records.

Notices sent by first-class mail shall be deposited in the United States mails at least five days before the time set for the meeting. Notices given by personal delivery, telephone, or electronic transmission shall be delivered, telephoned, or sent, respectively, at least 48 hours before the time set for the meeting.

The notice shall state the time of the meeting and the place, if the place is other than the corporation's principal office. The notice need not specify the purpose of the meeting.

## Waiver of Notice ##

Notice of a meeting need not be given to any director who, either before or after the meeting, signs a waiver of notice, a written consent to the holding of the meeting, or an approval of the minutes of the meeting. The waiver of notice or consent need not specify the purpose of the meeting. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meetings. Notice of a meeting need not be given to any director who attends the meeting and who, before or at the beginning of the meeting, does not protest the lack of notice.

## Action Without a Meeting ##

Any action that the board is required or permitted to take may be taken without a meeting if all board members consent in writing to the action; provided, however, that the consent of any director who has a material financial interest in a transaction to which the corporation is a party and who is an "interested director" as defined in Corporations Code section 5233 shall not be required for approval of that transaction. Such action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as any other validly approved action of the board. All such consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board.

## Fees and Compensation of Directors ##

The Corporation shall not pay any compensation to Directors for services rendered to the Corporation as Directors, except that Directors may be reimbursed for expenses incurred in the performance of their duties to the Corporation, in reasonable amounts as approved by the Board.

Also, Directors may not be compensated for rendering services to the Corporation in a capacity other than as Directors, unless such compensation is reasonable and further provided that not more than 49% of the persons serving as Directors may be "interested persons" which, for purposes of this [Fees and Compensation of Directors][] only, means:

  * any person currently being compensated by the Corporation for services rendered to it within the previous 12 months, whether as a full or part-time Officer or other employee, independent contractor, or otherwise, excluding any reasonable compensation paid to a Director as Director; or
  * any brother, sister, ancestor, descendant, spouse, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, mother-in-law, or father-in-law of any such person.

### Meetings and Action of Committees ###

Minutes of each meeting shall be kept and shall be filed with the corporate records. The board may adopt rules for the governance of any committee as long as the rules are consistent with these bylaws. If the board has not adopted rules, the committee may do so.

## Compensation of Officers ##

### Salaries Fixed by Board ###

The salaries of Officers, if any, shall be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board or by the person or Committee to whom the Board has delegated this function, and no Officer shall be prevented from receiving such salary by reason of the fact that he or she is also a Director, provided, however, that such compensation paid to a Director for serving as an Officer shall only be allowed if permitted under the provisions of [Fees and Compensation of Directors][]. In all cases, any salaries received by Officers shall be reasonable and given in return for services actually rendered for the Corporation which relate to the performance of the public benefit purposes of the Corporation. No salaried Officer serving as a Director shall be permitted to vote on his or her own compensation as an Officer.

### Fairness of Compensation ###

The Board shall periodically review the fairness of compensation, including benefits, paid to every person, regardless of title, with powers, duties, or responsibilities comparable to the president, chief executive officer, treasurer, or chief financial officer (i) once such person is hired, (ii) upon any extension or renewal of such person’s term of employment, and (iii) when such person’s compensation is modified (unless all employees are subject to the same general modification of compensation).

# Contracts With Directors #

No director of this corporation nor any other corporation, firm, association, or other entity in which one or more of this corporation's directors are directors or have a material financial interest, shall be interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract or transaction with this corporation, unless

  * the material facts regarding that director's financial interest in such contract or transaction or regarding such common directorship, officership, or financial interest are fully disclosed in good faith and noted in the minutes, or are known to all members of the board prior to the board's consideration of such contract or transaction;
  * such contract or transaction is authorized in good faith by a majority of the board by a vote sufficient for that purpose without counting the votes of the interested directors;
  * before authorizing or approving the transaction, the board considers and in good faith decides after reasonable investigation that the corporation could not obtain a more advantageous arrangement with reasonable effort under the circumstances; and
  * the corporation for its own benefit enters into the transaction, which is fair and reasonable to the corporation at the time the transaction is entered into.

This Section does not apply to a transaction that is part of an educational or charitable program of this corporation if it

  * is approved or authorized by the corporation in good faith and without unjustified favoritism and
  * results in a benefit to one or more directors or their families because they are in the class of persons intended to be benefited by the educational or charitable program of this corporation,

# Loans to Directors and Officers #

This corporation shall not lend any money or property to or guarantee the obligation of any director or officer without the approval of the California Attorney General, provided, however, that the corporation may advance money to a director or officer of the corporation for expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in the performance of his or her duties if that director or officer would be entitled to reimbursement for such expenses by the corporation.

# Indemnification #

To the fullest extent permitted by law, this corporation shall indemnify its directors, officers, employees, and other persons described in Corporations Code section 5238(a), including persons formerly occupying any such positions, against all expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with any "proceeding," as that term is used in that section, and including an action by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a person described in that section. "Expenses," as used in this bylaw, shall have the same meaning as in that section of the Corporations Code. On written request to the board by any person seeking indemnification under Corporations Code section 5238(b) or section 5238(c) the board shall promptly decide under Corporations Code section 5238(e) whether the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Corporations Code section 5238(b) or section 5238(c) has been met and, if so, the board shall authorize indemnification. If the board cannot authorize indemnification, because the number of directors who are parties to the proceeding with respect to which indemnification is sought prevents the formation of a quorum of directors who are not parties to that proceeding, the board shall promptly call a public meeting. At that meeting, persons eligible to vote shall determine under Corporations Code section 5238(e) whether the applicable standard of conduct has been met and, if so, the eligible voters present at the meeting in person or by proxy shall authorize indemnification.

To the fullest extent permitted by law and except as otherwise determined by the board in a specific instance, expenses incurred by a person seeking indemnification under this Article of these bylaws in defending any proceeding covered by that Section shall be advanced by the corporation before final disposition of the proceeding, on receipt by the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of that person that the advance will be repaid unless it is ultimately found that the person is entitled to be indemnified by the corporation for those expenses.

# Meetings #

      * posting on an electronic message board or network that the corporation has designated for those communications, together with a separate notice to the recipient of the posting, which transmission shall be validly delivered on the later of the posting or delivery of the separate notice of it; or
      * other means of electronic communication;
  * To a recipient who has provided an unrevoked consent to the use of those means of transmission for communications; and

A proxy shall be deemed signed if the person's name is placed on the proxy by the person or the person's attorney-in-fact, whether by manual signature, typewriting, facsimile transmission, or otherwise.

### Subject Matter of Proxy to Be Stated ###

Any proxy covering matters for which a public vote is required shall not be valid unless the proxy sets forth the general nature of the matter to be voted on or, in an election of directors, the proxy lists the persons who have been nominated at the time the notice of the vote is given to the public. Such matters include amendments of the articles of incorporation or bylaws changing proxy rights; certain other amendments of the articles of incorporation; removal of directors without cause; filling vacancies on the board of directors; the sale, lease, exchange, conveyance, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all corporate assets, unless the transaction is in the usual and regular course of the corporation's activities; the principal terms of a merger or the amendment of a merger agreement; or the election to dissolve the corporation.

### Revocability of Proxies ###

No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date of the proxy, unless provided otherwise in the proxy, except that the maximum term of a proxy shall be three years after the date of execution. A validly executed proxy shall continue in full force and effect until either

  * it is revoked by the person executing it, before the vote is cast under that proxy
      * by a writing delivered to the corporation stating that the proxy is revoked, or
      * by a subsequent proxy executed by that person and presented to the meeting, or
      * as to any meeting, by that person's personal attendance and voting at the meeting; or
  * written notice of the death or incapacity of the maker of the proxy is received by the corporation before the vote under that proxy is counted. A proxy may not be irrevocable.

## Adjournment and Notice of Adjourned Meetings ##

Any public meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of the majority of the voting power represented at the meeting, either in person or by proxy. No meeting may be adjourned for more than 45 days. When a public meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned (or the means of electronic transmission by and to the corporation or electronic video screen communication, if any, by which the public may participate) are announced at the meeting at which adjournment is taken. If after adjournment a new record date is fixed for notice or voting, a public notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting.

# Insurance #

This corporation shall have the right, and shall use its best efforts, to purchase and maintain insurance to the full extent permitted by law on behalf of its officers, directors, employees, and other agents, to cover any liability asserted against or incurred by any officer, director, employee, or agent in such capacity or arising from the officer's, director's, employee's, or agent's status as such.

# Maintenance of Corporate Records #

This corporation shall keep the following:

  * Adequate and correct books and records of account;
  * Minutes of the proceedings of its board and committees of the board; and
  * Minutes of the proceedings of any public meetings.

The minutes and other books and records shall be kept either in written form or in any other form capable of being converted into clearly legible tangible form or in any combination of the two.

# Inspection Rights #

## Public's Right to Inspect ##

### Maintenance and Inspection of Articles and Bylaws ###

This corporation shall keep at its principal California office the original or a copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended to the current date, which shall be open to inspection by the public at all reasonable times during office hours. If the corporation has no business office in California, the secretary shall, on the written request of any person, furnish to that person a copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended to the current date.

### Accounting Records and Minutes ###

On written demand on the corporation, any person may inspect, copy, and make extracts of the accounting books and records and the minutes of the proceedings of the board of directors and committees of the board at any reasonable time for any reasonable purpose. Any such inspection and copying may be made in person or by the person's agent or attorney. This right of inspection extends to the records of any subsidiary of the corporation.

## Directors' Right to Inspect ##

Every director shall have the absolute right at any reasonable time to inspect the corporation's books, records, documents of every kind, physical properties, and the records of each subsidiary. The inspection may be made in person or by the director's agent or attorney. The right of inspection includes the right to copy and make extracts of documents,

# Required Reports #

## Annual Report ##

The board shall cause an annual report to be sent to the directors within 120 days after the end of the corporation's fiscal year. That report shall contain the following information, in appropriate detail:

  * The assets and liabilities, including the trust funds, of the corporation as of the end of the fiscal year;
  * The principal changes in assets and liabilities, including trust funds;
  * The corporation's revenue or receipts, both unrestricted and restricted to particular purposes;
  * The corporation's expenses or disbursements for both general and restricted purposes;
  * Any information required by [Maintenance and Inspection of Articles and Bylaws] of these bylaws; and
  * An independent accountants' report or, if none, the certificate of an authorized officer of the corporation that such statements were prepared without audit from the corporation's books and records.

This requirement of an annual report shall not apply if the corporation receives less than $25,000 in gross receipts during the fiscal year, provided, however, that the information specified above for inclusion in an annual report must be furnished annually to all directors and to any person who requests it in writing. If the board approves, the corporation may send the report and any accompanying material sent pursuant to this section by electronic transmission.

## Annual Statement of Certain Transactions and Indemnifications ##

As part of the annual report, or as a separate document if no annual report is issued, the corporation shall, within 120 days after the end of the corporation's fiscal year, annually prepare and furnish to each director a statement of any transaction or indemnification of the following kind:

  * Any transaction
      * in which the corporation, or its parent or subsidiary, was a party,
      * in which an "interested person" had a direct or indirect material financial interest, and
      * which involved more than $50,000 or was one of several transactions with the same interested person involving, in the aggregate, more than $50,000. For this purpose, an "interested person" is either
          * any director or officer of the corporation, its parent or subsidiary (but mere common directorship shall not be considered such an interest); or
          * any holder of more than 10 percent of the voting power of the corporation, its parent, or its subsidiary. The statement shall include a brief description of the transaction, the names of interested persons involved, their relationship to the corporation, the nature of their interest in the transaction and, if practicable, the amount of that interest, provided that if the transaction was with a partnership in which the interested person is a partner, only the interest of the partnership need be stated.
  * Any indemnifications or advances aggregating more than $10,000 paid during the fiscal year to any officer or director of the corporation under [Indemnification] of these bylaws, unless that indemnification has already been approved under Corporations Code section 5238(e)(2).

# Construction and Definitions #

## Construction ##

Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions in the California Nonprofit Corporation Law shall govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the masculine gender includes the feminine and neuter, the singular includes the plural, the plural includes the singular, and the term "person" includes both a legal entity and a natural person.

## Definitions ##

### Quorum ###

Attendance of all but one (1) of the authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business except adjournment.  Every action taken or decision made by a consensus of the voting block at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present shall be an act of the Corporation.

Directors may waive participation in a meeting by submitting a notice of written consent.  This waiver is only valid for the specified meeting and reduces the authorized number of directors needed to reach quorum for that meeting.

### Voting Block ###

All eligible voters present at a meeting, either in person or represented by a proxy, that choose to participate in a call to vote shall constitute the voting block.  Every action taken or decision made by a consensus of the voting block at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present shall be an act of the Corporation.

### Consensus ###

The affirmative vote of all but one (1) of the voting block shall be deemed an approval by consensus.  Every action taken or decision made by a consensus of the voting block at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present shall be an act of the Corporation.

### Eligible Voter ###

Any director or officer of the Corporation is an eligible voter.  In addition, all persons of the general public shall be entitled to vote at any public meeting provided they have attended at least two (2) of the most recent three (3) public meetings.

# Amendment of Bylaws #

## Amendment by Directors ##

The Board may adopt, amend or repeal bylaws. Such power is subject to the following limitations:

  * Where any provision of these Bylaws requires the vote of a larger proportion of the Directors than otherwise is required by law, such provision may not be altered, amended or repealed except by the vote of such greater number.
  * No amendment may extend the term of a Director beyond that for which such Director was elected.
  * If bylaws are adopted, amended or repealed at a meeting of the Board, such action is authorized only at a duly called and held meeting for which written notice of such meeting, setting forth the proposed bylaw revisions with explanations therefor, is given in accordance with these Bylaws, unless such notice is waived in accordance with these Bylaws.
